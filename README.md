# Wordle Machine (and Wordle) (in commandline)

My implementation of the Wordle game (inspired by https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) and my interactive solving machine for the Wordle game. The strategy is originated from this blog post [Best Wordle Strategy â€” Explore or Exploit](https://slc.is/#Best%20Wordle%20Strategy%20%E2%80%94%20Explore%20or%20Exploit) and I'm still working on some optimization over that.

### How to run?

```shell
git clone https://github.com/KevinXuxuxu/wordle_machine.git
cd wordle_machine
```

- Wordle game:
```shell
# need python 3
# ! for correct letter at correct position
# ? for correct letter at wrong position
# _ for wrong letter
$ python3.9 wordle.py        
Welcome to Wordle!

- Better cmd option for alternate strategy choice
